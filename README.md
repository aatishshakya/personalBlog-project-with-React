this is my first project named as Personal Blog with react. The main objective of this project is to put my theoretical knowledge of react js into practice and get acquaintance with the commands and library of reactjs.
In this project, the user can post his/her personal blog with images, title, author and published date as shown in the individual blog. The rest you can see by running this code in your pc.
